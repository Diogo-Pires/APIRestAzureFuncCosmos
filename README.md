# Trello-Like App

This is a basic Trello-like application developed with .NET 8 and Azure Functions (in-process). The purpose of this project is to showcase my code and experiment with technologies that I cannot use at work.

Tech Stack

.NET 8 - Core framework for the application

Azure Functions (in-process) - Serverless computing for handling tasks

OpenTelemetry - Distributed tracing for performance monitoring

Cosmos DB (NoSQL) - Scalable and flexible database

Redis (L1 and L2 Cache) - Optimizing performance with caching layers

FluentResult - Handling and propagating errors elegantly

FluentValidation - Validating input data

xUnit - Unit testing framework

Jaeger - Tracing and debugging tool

Features

Create, update, delete, and list tasks (CRUD operations)

Caching strategies with Redis for improved performance

Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry and Jaeger

Setup and Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>

Install dependencies:

dotnet restore

Configure environment variables for Cosmos DB and Redis.

Run the application:

func start

Testing

Run unit tests with:

dotnet test

Future Improvements

Optimized queries and indexing in Cosmos DB

Advanced filtering and aggregations

Authentication & authorization

Web-based UI with React

More advanced analytics with OpenTelemetry

Machine model predictions to fit the best users to their tasks 

This project serves as a sandbox for testing and improving my skills in cloud-based, distributed, and high-performance applications.
